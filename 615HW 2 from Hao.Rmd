Re-write the Lake Huron shiny application from last class using ggplot2.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
suppressMessages(library("tidyverse"))
library(tidyverse)
data("LakeHuron")
head(LakeHuron)
year=c(1875:1972)
LakeHuron_point=c(LakeHuron[c(1:98)])
LakeHuron_New=data.frame(year, LakeHuron_point)
head(LakeHuron_New)
ggplot(LakeHuron_New)+geom_point(aes(x=year, y=LakeHuron_point))+geom_line(aes(x=year, y=LakeHuron_point))
```

```{r}
"from the plot, we can get that this looks 
like the same as the previous one by using 
the shinny, this one I use the ggplot to express that "
```
